<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CO2 Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical CO2 Sensors</li><li>NDIR CO2 Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CO2 sensors detect the presence of carbon dioxide gas in the atmosphere. Chemical CO2 sensors rely on a chemical reaction to detect CO2 levels, while NDIR (Non-Dispersive Infrared) CO2 sensors use infrared light to measure CO2 concentrations. Chemical CO2 sensors are typically less expensive and simpler, while NDIR CO2 sensors are more accurate and reliable. Both types of sensors play a crucial role in monitoring indoor air quality, industrial processes, and greenhouse gas emissions.</p></p>
