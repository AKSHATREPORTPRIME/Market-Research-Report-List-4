<p><strong>The HPMC Capsules Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>HPMC with Gelling Agent</li><li>HPMC without Gelling Agent</li></ul></p>

Both types cater to different requirements for controlled or immediate release of the active ingredients in pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements.</p></p>
