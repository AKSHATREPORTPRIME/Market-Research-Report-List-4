<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TIG Welding Torch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>TIG welding torches can be classified into two main types based on their cooling mechanism: water-cooled and air-cooled. Water-cooled torches use water to dissipate heat generated during the welding process, allowing for longer welding times without overheating. They are suitable for high-temperature applications. On the other hand, air-cooled torches rely on airflow to cool down the torch, making them more lightweight and portable. They are typically used for lighter welding tasks that do not require continuous operation at high temperatures.</p></p>
