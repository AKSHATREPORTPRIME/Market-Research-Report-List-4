<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Resistant Flexible Sealant Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastometric Type</li><li>Intumescent Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire-resistant flexible sealants are crucial products used in construction to prevent the spread of fire through gaps and joints in buildings. There are two main types of fire-resistant flexible sealants: elastomeric type and intumescent type. Elastomeric sealants are rubber-based and provide a flexible barrier against fire, smoke, and water. Intumescent sealants contain chemicals that expand when exposed to heat, forming a protective char layer to block fire penetration. Both types play a vital role in enhancing fire safety in buildings.</p></p>
