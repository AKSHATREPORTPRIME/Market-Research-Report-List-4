<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water Detection Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Water Sensors</li><li>Non-contacting Water Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Contact water sensors are devices that come in direct contact with water to detect its presence. These sensors operate by physically touching the water and are commonly used in applications where precise detection is essential. On the other hand, non-contacting water sensors utilize technologies such as ultrasound or infrared to detect water without coming into direct contact with it. These sensors are suitable for applications where avoiding contamination or reducing the risk of damage is a priority. Both types play a crucial role in various industries and applications.</p></p>
