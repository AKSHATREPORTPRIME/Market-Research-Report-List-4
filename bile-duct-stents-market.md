<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bile Duct Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Covered Type</li><li>Uncovered Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bile duct stents are medical devices used to relieve blockages in the bile duct caused by tumors or other conditions. Covered type stents have a coating that prevents the stent from migrating or becoming blocked by ingrowth of tissue. Uncovered type stents do not have this coating, allowing for better drainage but also increasing the risk of tissue ingrowth. Both types of stents are used in the treatment of biliary obstructions, but the choice between covered and uncovered stents depends on the specific needs of the patient.</p></p>
