<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hollow Polysulfone Dialyzer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Flux Membrane</li><li>High Flux Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hollow Polysulfone dialyzers are available in two main types - Low Flux Membrane and High Flux Membrane. Low flux membranes have a larger pore size and are designed for regular dialysis treatments to remove waste products and excess fluids from the blood. High flux membranes, on the other hand, have a smaller pore size which allows for better removal of toxins and higher clearance rates. They are typically used in patients with more severe kidney dysfunction or in more intensive dialysis treatments.</p></p>
