<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The RF Power Meters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat-based Meters</li><li>Diode Detector-based Meters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>RF power meters are used to measure the power of radio frequency signals. There are two main types of RF power meters: heat-based meters and diode detector-based meters. Heat-based meters operate by converting RF power into heat, which is then measured to determine the power level. Diode detector-based meters, on the other hand, use diode detectors to convert RF power into DC voltage, which is then measured. Both types of power meters are essential tools for accurately measuring RF power in various applications.</p></p>
