<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Respirator Fit Testing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Quantitative Respirator Fit Testing</li><li>Qualitative Respirator Fit Testing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Quantitative Respirator Fit Testing involves the use of specialized equipment to measure the amount of leakage into the mask, providing a numerical result indicating the effectiveness of the fit. This method is highly accurate and suitable for high-risk environments. On the other hand, Qualitative Respirator Fit Testing relies on the user's sense of taste, smell, or irritation to detect any leakage. While this method is less precise, it is still widely used in industries where quantitative testing may not be feasible.</p></p>
