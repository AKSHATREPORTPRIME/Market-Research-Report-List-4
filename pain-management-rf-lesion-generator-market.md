<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pain Management RF Lesion Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Radio Frequency (RF)</li><li>Pulsed Radio Frequency (PRF)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pain Management RF Lesion Generators are devices used to treat chronic pain through the application of radiofrequency energy to nerve tissues. Conventional RF uses continuous high-frequency waves to create lesioning of nerve fibers, providing long-lasting pain relief. Pulsed RF, on the other hand, delivers intermittent low-frequency waves to interrupt pain signals without causing tissue damage. Both types of RF generators are effective in managing pain, providing patients with options for personalized treatment based on their specific needs.</p></p>
