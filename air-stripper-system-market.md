<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Stripper System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sieve Tray System</li><li>Packed Tower System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>An air stripper system is used to remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from contaminated water through air stripping. There are two main types of air stripper systems: sieve tray system and packed tower system. </p><p>In a sieve tray system, contaminated water is passed through a series of trays where the VOCs are stripped and transferred to an air stream. In a packed tower system, contaminated water is passed through a tower packed with materials like plastic, ceramic, or metal to promote air-water contact and VOC removal. Both systems are effective in removing VOCs from water.</p></p>
