<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Poppet Solenoid Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally-closed</li><li>Normally open</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Poppet solenoid valves are usually classified into two main types: normally-closed and normally-open. </p><p>Normally-closed valves are designed to remain closed when the solenoid is not activated, allowing no flow of fluid. When the solenoid is energized, it opens the valve to allow fluid to pass through. </p><p>On the other hand, normally-open valves are designed to remain open when the solenoid is not activated, allowing fluid to flow freely. When the solenoid is energized, it closes the valve to stop the flow of fluid.</p></p>
