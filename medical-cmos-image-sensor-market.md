<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical CMOS Image Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>FSI</li><li>BSI</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Medical CMOS Image Sensor Market is divided into two main types: Front-side illuminated (FSI) and Back-side illuminated (BSI) sensors. FSI sensors have the light-sensitive elements on the front side, which limits light absorption and can produce lower image quality. On the other hand, BSI sensors have the light-sensitive elements on the back side, which allows for more light absorption and higher image quality. BSI sensors are considered more advanced and are increasingly being used in medical imaging applications.</p></p>
