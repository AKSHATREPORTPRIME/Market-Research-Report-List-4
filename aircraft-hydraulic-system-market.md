<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Hydraulic System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Center</li><li>Closed-Center</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aircraft hydraulic system market can be categorized into two main types: open-center and closed-center systems. Open-center systems have a constant flow of hydraulic fluid, with the excess being routed back to the reservoir. This type is more common in smaller aircraft. Closed-center systems, on the other hand, have a variable flow of hydraulic fluid, which is directed to different parts of the system as needed. This type is more commonly found in larger aircraft due to its efficiency and flexibility in managing hydraulic power.</p></p>
